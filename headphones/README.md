This is a simple and clean landing page for a headphone brand — built with HTML and CSS as part of the ALX HTML/CSS project. The design comes straight from Figma, and the goal was to match it as closely as possible, while keeping it responsive and good-looking.

💡 What It Does

Switches to mobile view when the screen is 480px or less

Cool hover effects for links (#FF6565) and buttons (opacity drops to 0.9)

Max content width: 1000px, centered on the screen

🛠️ Tools Used
HTML5

CSS3

Media Queries

Fonts: Source Sans Pro + Spin-Cycle-OT

🧪 How to Run It
Clone the repo

Go to the headphones/ folder

Open index.html in your browser

Resize the screen to see the responsive magic happen ✨

🎨 Notes
If fonts don’t load, grab them online or from the Figma link

Some spacing values were in decimals, so I rounded them up

No fancy frameworks here — just raw, clean code
